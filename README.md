# COVID-19 SQL Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs an analysis of global COVID-19 data using SQLite. The analysis explores infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress across different countries.

## Dataset Description
The analysis uses two main datasets:
- **CovidDeaths1**: Contains COVID-19 case and death statistics by country and date
- **CovidVaccinations**: Contains COVID-19 vaccination data by country and date
Both datasets are sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) and were split into two tables for analysis purposes.

**Time Period**: January 2020 – December 2021

**Coverage**: 200+ countries, daily data

**Key Columns**: location, date, population, total_cases, total_deaths, new_vaccinations

## Analysis Questions
1. Total Cases vs Total Deaths: What is the death percentage for each country?
2. Infection Rate vs Population: What percentage of each country's population contracted COVID-19?
3. Highest Infection Rates: Which countries had the highest infection rates compared to their population?
4. Highest Death Counts: Which countries and continents had the highest death counts?
5. Global Numbers: What are the worldwide totals for cases, deaths, and death percentages?
6. Vaccination Progress: How are vaccination efforts progressing across different countries?

## Key Findings
### Infection & Death Analysis
- Global Death Percentage: ~1-2% of confirmed cases resulted in death
- Highest Death Count (Country): United States with over 1,000,000 deaths
- Highest Death Count (Continent): Europe had the highest total deaths
- Highest Infection Rate: Small countries (e.g., San Marino, Andorra) had highest infection rates
- UK Death Rate: Death percentage decreased over time as treatments improved.

### Vaccination Analysis
- Highest Vaccination Rate: Countries like Israel, UAE, and Portugal exceeded 90% vaccination coverage
- Vaccination Progress: Rolling vaccination counts show rapid acceleration in early 2021
- Wealthier countries: generally achieved higher vaccination rates
- Significant disparities: exist between developed and developing nations

### Key Insights
- Large population countries (US, India, Brazil) had highest absolute death counts
- Lockdown measures correlated with lower infection rates
- Death rates were highest during the initial pandemic waves
- Vaccination rates inversely correlated with death rates over time

## Key Queries
- Total Cases vs Total Deaths

- Global Numbers

## Tools Used
- SQLite
- DB Browser for SQLite

## How to Run
1. Open DB Browser for SQLite
2. Load the database file
3. Run the queries in `analysis.sql`
